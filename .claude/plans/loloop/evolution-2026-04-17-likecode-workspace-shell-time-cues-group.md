# Evolution 2026-04-17 - LikeCode Workspace Shell Time Cues Group

## Plan

- Continue Task 13 from the active LikeCode workspace app plan.
- Keep the pass bounded to one shell time-cues semantic grouping cleanup.
- Avoid touching `site/css/style.css` because it already has unrelated uncommitted changes in this worktree.

## Completed

- Added `role="group"` and `aria-label="shell 输出同步时间和本地 provenance 时间说明"` to the time-cues row in `site/app-likecode-workspace.html`.
- This exposes the `output sync` and `updated` distinction as one shell timing semantics context.
- Updated `site/md/app-likecode-workspace.md` with the behavior note.
- Updated `.claude/plans/loloop/active-likecode-workspace-app-plan-v1.md` with the completed pass and next handoff.

## Validation

- `python3 -m py_compile tools/codex_loop_web_relay.py`
- `node --check site/js/likecode-workspace.js`
- `python3 tools/check_site_md_parity.py`
- `python3 tools/refresh_site_topic_metadata.py`
- `git diff --check -- site/app-likecode-workspace.html site/md/app-likecode-workspace.md .claude/plans/loloop/active-likecode-workspace-app-plan-v1.md .claude/plans/loloop/evolution-2026-04-17-likecode-workspace-shell-time-cues-group.md`

## Failed / Deferred

- Deferred CSS focus-ring work because `site/css/style.css` already had unrelated uncommitted changes before this pass.

## Next Handoff

- Continue Task 13.
- Stay on structural shell-surface improvements and pick one more small operator-control or explanation pass after the time-cues group pass.
